bands with the licensed carriers of an LTE network to pave way for LTE
unlicensed networks. However, operations in the unlicensed bands must address
the coexistence challenges. For example, Wi-Fi networks at 2.4 GHz bands, e.g.,
802.11b/g/n, must find the best channel 1S among three non-overlapping channels
for operation in a very-dense WLAN deployment. Additionally, 2.4 GHz band
accommodates also non-Wi-Fi technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, or
microwave ovens which all create interference on WLANs. As for 5GHz which has many
more non-overlapping channels compared to 2.4 GHz, the more severe challenge is
to coexist with technologies other than 802.11n/ac/ax networks, namely
unlicensed LTE networks and radars. The main coexistence mechanism of Wi-Fi is <b>listen-before-talk</b>
(LBT) which is also known as carrier sense multiple access with collision
avoidance (CSMA/CA) </span><span

lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[6]</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>. Here, a station with a
traffic to transmit must first check whether the medium is free or not. To
decide on the state of the medium, two approaches exist: carrier sense and
energy detection. In carrier sensing, a Wi-Fi node decodes the preamble of a Wi-Fi
frame that is received above some energy detection level. The node extracts the
information from the physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) header which
carries information about the occupancy duration of the medium by that ongoing
flow. This mechanism is also referred to as channel reservation. With this
information, a Wi-Fi node knows when to re-start sensing the medium for a
transmission opportunity. Energy detection on the other hand is a simpler
approach in which a candidate transmitter decides that the air is free if the
signal level is below a predefined energy detection (ED) threshold. This
approach is used for detecting inter-technology signals, where the received
signal is not decodable – belongs to other technologies (or corrupted Wi-Fi
signals). Despite its simplicity, ED requires more effort on a potential
transmitter as it must constantly sense the energy level in the air to detect a
transmission opportunity. As LTE follows a scheduled medium access on the
licensed spectrum, there is no notion or necessity of politeness or LBT in more
technical terms. However, it is vital for LTE unlicensed to implement such
mechanisms for coexistence with Wi-Fi and other unlicensed LTE networks at 5
GHz bands. Currently, frequency-domain sharing is a first step only. In other
words, an LTE small cell first checks the channel activities and selects a
clear channel, if any. For time sharing, there are two approaches taken by two variants
of LTE unlicensed: duty cycling by LTE-U and LBT by License-Assisted-Access
(LAA). LTE-U which is an industry-led effort lets small cells apply duty
cycling where during the OFF periods Wi-Fi can access the medium. As this
approach does not mandate LBT before turning small cell transmissions on, it
may degrade Wi-Fi performance drastically. LAA requires LBT-like WiFi’s
CSMA/CA. Conversely, we aim to employ LAA to develop a global solution in
contrast to LTE-U which is only compliant to countries like US, Korea, China
where LBT is not mandatory. We overview basics of these two variants and list
the major issues in their peaceful coexistence with Wi-Fi networks </span><span

in a practical setting. <b>Which unlicensed channel to select for each LAA SBS

their small cells independently, there is surely the question of how to select
an unlicensed channel to aggregate, particularly in case there are more cells
than the number of available channels. One way of channel selection is to let
every LAA BS learn from its own observations via trial-and-error, Q-learning
[3]. Which unlicensed carrier to aggregate and how long to use this carrier? -

lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>. <b>Can Wi-Fi exploit
ML for defending itself against LTE-U interference</b>?- Different than the
literature which develops coexistence solutions to be deployed at the LTE base
stations for Wi-Fi/LTE setting, proposes to also equip the Wi-Fi APs with a
tool that estimates the ON-duration of an existing LTE-U network in the
neighborhood. Moreover, the developed solution can estimate the remaining
airtime for the Wi-Fi AP based on the LTE’s predicted ON duration. Key idea of
Wi-PLUS is to detect the times where LTE-U has an ongoing transmission using
the data passively collected from the MAC FSM of the NIC. However, although
LTE-U signal may not be detected above the ED level, it may still have a severe
impact on Wi-Fi. Thus, PHY-layer analysis solely on signal level is short of
detecting the moderate interference regime. Wi-PLUS overcomes this challenge by
combining data from MAC FSM states and ARQ missing acknowledgments. Sampled
data from a testbed has a lot of noise due to imperfections of the measuring
devices and the complex interactions among the coexisting systems as well as
PHY and MAC layers. Wi-PLUS applies K-means clustering to detect outliers on
the estimated LTE-U on-durations. After filtering the data points based on the
signal’s frequency harmonics, WiPLUS calculates the LTE- U on-time as the
average of the data points, each of which corresponds to an estimate of LTE-U
on-time. <b>Can we estimate WiFi link performance by learning from real-world
link capacity measurements? </b>– In a multi- AP setting, an AP can select the
operation channel based on the expected capacity of the existing links. The
traditional way is to take the SNIR-based capacity estimate into account, i.e.,
Shannon’s capacity formula. However, this capacity model may sometimes fail to
represent the complex interactions between PHY and MAC layers, e.g., partially
overlapping channels in case of channel bonding in new 802.11ac/ax standards.
The idea of </span><span

learning as a tool to model the complex interactions among many factors such as
power and PHY rate of a neighboring Wi-Fi link implicitly rather than modelling
it explicitly.</span></p>
